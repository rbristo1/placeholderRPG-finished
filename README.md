How to Run:
1. Use 'make' to compile the program
2. Use ./main to run the program

How to Play:
To navigate the menus, wasd are used to move up, left, down, and right respectively.   

Enter is used to finalize a selection  

q is used to exit submenus (ie: inventory, attack selection)  

i is used to open the inventory in the map screen  



When starting the game, you will be prompted to select a class, use the number keys to select one. Afterwards you will need to input a name for you character, type it in and press enter to finalize it. After this you will be placed on the map as a red p, use wasd to move around the map. There will be various letters on the map, moving into them will do the following things:   

w = upgrades the character's weapon  

c = a chest with a permanent upgrade scroll  

s = a skill scroll for your character to learn a new attack  

k = a key to open the locks in the main room with  

L = a lock preventing access to the next floor of the dungeon  

<+> = stairs to the next floor

<#> = doorway to another room (flush with the walls)  

S = the powerful scroll of seg fault   

D = Xylograth, the Being of Digerence  


Be careful while navigating the map, as enemies will try to ambush you, choose your paths wisely! If you run into an enemy, the music will fade out and then the batte screen will appear. Use your character's abilities and manage your HP to make sure you defeat the enemy. If your HP goes to 0 or below, your character will die and the game will need to restart.  


Defeating enemies will reward a potion:
Take this risk/reward into account when venturing into new rooms. Potions are temporary and will increase your stats by a large amount for 1 battle. Due to their temporary nature, you CANNOT use potions outside of battles. Attempting to use one outside of battle will trash it to free up the inventory slot.

Your player has 5 stats:   

DEF = Physical Defence  

MGA = Magic Attack  

MGD = Magic Defence  

ATK = Physical Attack  

SPD = speed  


Using this knowledge, you must delve into the Dungeon to defeat the terrible Xylograth in order to reclaim the powerful scroll of digerence!
