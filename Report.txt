The biggest thing that went well is that we finished. We honestly weren't sure we would. Writing the music went well, although that is unrelated to the computer science side of things. Making the battle system went pretty well, although there were some rough patches with adding in the actions and adding in the items. The game design iteslf also went pretty well, we were able to make it pretty fun (in my opinion). In addition, making the battle screen wasn't aweful. As for things that did not go well, there were a lot of them. Implementing weapons and items was a pain, getting miniAudio to cooperate was sometimes annoying, making the map screen function properly was incredibly aweful. We spent about 4 hours troubleshooting it. There was a problem with the line characters we were using actually being stored as ints, so when we tried doing collision with them in the vector of strings that was the map, we ran into issues of them being too large. After fixing that, we ran into issues of the player corrupting the map while moving. We eventually found a workaround by making the map out of normal chars, and then replacing them with the multi-chars right before printing, so the collision was done with the normal ones. We should get full discrensionary points because together, we probably spent over 100 hours working on this project, and the complexity of it is much, much higher than what was required.

  Time Log:
  Andrew - About 50 Hours total
  Ryan   - About 50 Hours total

  We each spent 12 hours working on it the night of 12/2 into the morning, so we definitly met the time requirements, but we did not track it very closely.
